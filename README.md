# Tokenized Asset Management Contract

## Overview

This smart contract provides a framework for tokenizing assets and managing fractional ownership. It allows users to create tokenized assets with specified total supply, price, and metadata. Ownership can be transferred in fractional amounts, and the contract tracks ownership information and asset details.

## Key Features

* **Asset Creation:** Users can create new tokenized assets with customizable total supply, price, and metadata.
* **Fractional Ownership:** Assets can be owned fractionally, allowing multiple users to share ownership of a single asset.
* **Ownership Transfer:** Asset owners can transfer fractional ownership to other addresses.
* **Token Metadata:** Each tokenized asset is associated with a URI that can be used to retrieve metadata (e.g., images, descriptions).

## How it Works

1. **Asset Creation:** The `createAsset` function allows users to create new tokenized assets, specifying the total supply, price, and metadata URI.
2. **Fractional Ownership:** When an asset is created, the initial owner holds the entire supply. Ownership can be transferred in fractional amounts using the `transferOwnership` function.
3. **Ownership Tracking:** The contract tracks fractional ownership balances for each user and asset.
4. **Token Metadata:** The `tokenURI` function returns the metadata URI associated with a specific token ID.

## Usage

1. Deploy the contract to an Ethereum network.
2. Call the `createAsset` function to create new tokenized assets.
3. Transfer fractional ownership using the `transferOwnership` function.
4. Query fractional ownership balances using the `fractionalOwnership` function.
5. Retrieve token metadata using the `tokenURI` function.

## Security Considerations

* Ensure proper input validation to prevent vulnerabilities like integer overflows or underflows.
* Consider implementing additional security measures like access controls or rate limiting.
* Regularly audit the contract for potential vulnerabilities.

## Additional Notes

* This contract provides a basic framework for tokenized asset management. You can customize it to fit your specific use case by adding more features or modifying existing functionality.
* For production use, consider using a more robust and audited tokenization platform.
* Explore the potential of using IPFS or other decentralized storage solutions to store asset metadata.

## Getting Started:

### Installation and Deployment

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mishraji874/Tokenized-Asset-Management-Smart-Contract.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Tokenized-Asset-Management-Smart-Contract
3. Initialize Foundry and Forge:
    ```bash
    forge init
4. Create the ```.env``` file and paste the [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) api for the Sepolia Testnet and your Private Key from the Metamask.

5. Compile and deploy the smart contracts:

    If you want to deploy to the local network anvil then run this command:
    ```bash
    forge script script/DeployTokenizedAssetManagement.s.sol --rpc-url {LOCAL_RPC_URL} --private-key {PRIVATE_KEY}
    ```
    If you want to deploy to the Sepolia testnet then run this command:
    ```bash
    forge script script/DeployTokenizedAssetManagement.s.sol --rpc-url ${SEPOLIA_RPC_URL} --private-key ${PRIVATE_KEY}
### Running Tests

Run the automated tests for the smart contract:

```bash
forge test
```

By using this contract, you can create decentralized marketplaces or platforms for fractional ownership of various assets.
